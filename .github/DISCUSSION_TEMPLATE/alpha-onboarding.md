# Alpha onboarding and Q&A

Use this thread to:
- Ask questions about setup and integration
- Share quick feedback and small requests
- Drop minimal policy/intent snippets when something denies unexpectedly

Maintained status
- Current: v0.3.1
- Quickstart: https://github.com/Amara-ops/policy-runtime-ts#quickstart-5-minutes

Tips
- Bind to 127.0.0.1 (default) or set an auth token if exposing beyond localhost
- Check Decision.headroom/target_headroom to understand denials
- Use /reload for safe policy edits without resetting counters/logs

Weâ€™ll iterate fast on 0.3.x for onboarding friction.
